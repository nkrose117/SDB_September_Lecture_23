    ? While Loops

    - While loop, loops through a block of code WHILE a specific condition is true.

    !Structure:
    while (condition) {
        ...code to run/execute
    }

    - The main purpose for while loops are when the iteration is uncertain.
        - aka we don't know how much content is in the data we are referencing/looping through.

/* 
    ? Do While Loops
    - Also loop through a block of code while a specified condition is true BUT...
        ! loop will run the code block ONCE, BEFORE checking if the condition is true and will keep running as long as the condition stays true.
    
    Structure:
    do {
        code to run/execute
    } while ( condition )

    - Works just like while loops with the exception that it will run the code block at least once.
